### Speed up your workflow with simple tools set up

I would like to introduce my custom build for speeding up the workflow of FE developers.

And remember - your time is priceless!

### How to

First step - install dependencies:

~/ npm i

~/ npm i gulp-cli -g

While writing code make sure, to have SASS watcher is on, for immediate effect:

~/ npm run sass

To build your web project run following command:

~/ npm run gulp

### What is next?

Now you have built project in the /build directory.
Replace scripts/main.js to scripts/main.min.js in build/index.html, and you good to go.
